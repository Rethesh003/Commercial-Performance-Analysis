#Commercial Performance Analysis
Overview:

This project analyzes 10,000 rows of American Superstore Sales data (2022â€“2023) .
The dataset was cleaned using Python (Pandas & NumPy), transformed with SQL & DAX, and visualized in Power BI.
It provides business insights across Sales, Profit, Customers, Discounts, Regions, and Products.

 Methodology (Step by Step):
1. Data Cleaning (Python â€“ Pandas, NumPy)
Removed duplicates & null values.

Converted text dates into YYYY-MM-DD format.

Normalized column names (snake_case).

Created new derived columns like:

discounted_price = list_price Ã— (1 â€“ discount%)

profit = total_sales â€“ total_cost

2. ETL & SQL Queries
Imported cleaned CSV into database.

Monthly sales & profit trend

Top products & categories

Statewise & city sales

Discount vs profit impact

Customer retention & repeat purchase rate

3. DAX (Power BI)
Created measures for better insights:

Profit Margin % = SUM(Profit) / SUM(Sales)

Avg Order Value = SUM(Sales) / DISTINCTCOUNT(Order_Id)

Retention Rate % = Returning Customers / Total Customers

Avg Items per Order = SUM(Quantity) / DISTINCTCOUNT(Order_Id)

4. Visualization (Power BI)
Designed an interactive dashboard with:

KPI cards (Sales, Profit, Orders, AOV, Profit %)

Line charts (Monthly Trends)

Bar/Tree maps (Category, State, City insights)

Donut charts (Customer segmentation)

Scatter plots (Discount vs Profit)

Added slicers for Year, Category, Customer Type, Region.
